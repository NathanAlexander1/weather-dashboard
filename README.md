# weather-dashboard
Description:

This repo interacts with the weather API to display current weather patterns for various cities around the country. The user can search a city and the display will pull up today's weather as well as a 5 day forecast. Once a city is searched, it will be printed in a button below the search container so a new city can be plugged in. The user can then re-click old cities to pull their current weather back up.
